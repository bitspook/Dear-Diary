* Roadmap

** TODO Remove custom redux implementation

Enough playing. Working rxjs POC is in place, it's time we move the codebase to redux library. The less code (we have to maintain) the better.

** TODO Add redux-devtools

** TODO Add TypeScript

Port all code to Typescript

** TODO Remove Browsersync

- [ ] Remove browsersync dependency. Use simple express server with babel-hmr
- [ ] Add hmr snipper required to hot-push redux reducers
