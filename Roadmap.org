* Roadmap

** DONE Remove custom redux implementation
CLOSED: [2016-02-14 Sun 17:31]

Enough playing. Working rxjs POC is in place, it's time we move the codebase to redux library. The less code (we have to maintain) the better.

** DONE Add redux-devtools

** TODO Add TypeScript

Port all code to Typescript

** TODO Remove Browsersync
